Hi, my name is Caleb Daix. I am 12 years old and I make horrible cancerous YouTube videos. I like to play games such as Minecraft, Terraria, Plague Inc., and I don't have a PC, but I really want to play Slime Rancher. I like the Tabby Slimes. :3 </br>
Anyways that's basically all I'm going to put on the internet. </p>

--!--I know, I'm 12, there's like 7 year olds smarter than me.
